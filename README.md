## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS / SASS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology

### What I learned

I learned how to work with BEM and be able to improve my speed when writing CSS usign SASS!

### Continued development

I found useful to continue working with BEM and SASS. Even though, I want to use it on an entire website just to know how effective could be and then decide if I want to include this on my next projects.

### Useful resources

- [BEM & SASS](https://medium.com/laboratoria-how-to/creando-proyectos-css-mantenibles-con-sass-y-bem-54e013c7b1d9) - This helped me identify the possibility of reduce time when structuring and include styles to my websites.
